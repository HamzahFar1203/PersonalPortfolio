                    <p>Welcome to my portfolio website. I've been passionate about programming since eight years ago,
                       when I learned I could do it too. I was introduced to my first lines of code, when I took my first
                       programming class, "Web Development". I took the class hoping to start an exciting journey in
                       the world of programming; instead, I finished the class having learned nothing; however, I did not
                       follow the common pattern that most people may follow of losing motivation and giving up
                       on what they enjoy doing. The summer following that semester, I took the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
                       courses on Khan Academy, and I managed to learn everything the Web Development class failed to teach me,
                       and I did it all within a month. Since then, I've been fascinated with programming and enjoy learning
                       new languages and concepts.
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       My main goal is to become a Full Stack Web Developer, and I'm willing to learn whatever I need to
                       reach that goal.
                       <br>
